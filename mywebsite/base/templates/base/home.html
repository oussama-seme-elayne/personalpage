					<h4>Web Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>I have been working with web development since 2016, the
						period during which I have worked in different environments,
						from big consultancy companies to start-ups. I am a selfmotivated
						and self-taught professional who likes to solve
						problems.
						I merge a passion for usability and user experience with
						technical knowledge to create cool digital experiences. My
						repertoire includes programming languages and tools such as
						Django, Python, JavaScript, Wordpress, SQLite, configuration,
						CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and more.</p>
